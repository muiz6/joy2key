Map joystick to keyboard for apps that have poor joystick support.

## Background

![Chapter 1: The Boy and the Controller That Doesn't Work](/docs/title.png)

The MacOS is not famous for many things but videogames. In an attempt to play the games I enjoyed in
my childhood on an emulator on my Macbook many events came to be. While I could play some retro
games on the emulator, which shall not be named here. Playing on keyboard wasn't enough. Dad always
said:

"Son. Real gamers always play with a controller."

When I connected my logitec game controller it was surprise to see that all the buttons were mapped
incorrectly. A few things like the right analogue stick didn't even work. From controller testing
softwares I knew that my controller worked fine. So what was this emulation software which did not
allow remapping the controller buttons. With the lack of any better emulator the player had no
choice but to despair.

Failing my family legacy was never an option. It was time to come up with a solution, to forge a
script with powerful magic which could map the joystick input to that of a keyboard. And that is
how this script came to be.
